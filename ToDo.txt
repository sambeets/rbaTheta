Continuous development process

-- I/O format define
Define an input and output format for the algorithm/package.
Option to choose a Virtual power plant or a single turbine
Option for choosing multi-threading/ number of threads, etc. 

-- Date-time integreation
This functionality would allow to record the events within a specific time period.
Say if events are actively occuring in weekend or weekday. 


-- Angle correction (Done)


-- Begining and endings of the events
Remove the gap between the events. When plotted it appears
continious series and sequence of events.


-- Rainflow counting (done)
Functional rainflow counting cycles extracted to the result.


-- Plots
Define the plots to be in the algorithm
All data plots?

-- Frequency combinations
Combine the features within an event.
A combination of fetures define an event.
Can we retain the combinations as well.

-- Package the rbaTheta
Turn the alogorithm to a package

-- (optional) Sphynx 
This would enable a web page for the package 



Open questions

-- How to set the threshold?
Is there a way we can determine an optimal threshold?
Set a starting point of threshold and reconstruct. Then check the error. Keep the error as a threshold and iterate. 
Stop at a threshold where error is minimal. 

-- Event overlap
Significant and stationary events overlap each other. 
Is there a way to correct this behaviour?
There can be stationary events in significant but not the other way round. 

-- Prediction of the events
Spatial markov chain?

A) Original time series  B) extracted events with features

Reconstruct time series from the predicted events and compare with prediction from original time series. 
Predict the significant (deltaW) and stationary (average) and compare with original time series. 
Supply a real-times series and Significant events (deltaW and deltaT), stationary events (deltaT, average) as inputs to predict. 
Compare the three predictation accuracies.
