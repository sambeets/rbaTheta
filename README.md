# Ramping Behaviour Analysis
## Ramping Behavior Analysis (RBA) is an event detection technique for time-series data. The RBA extracts events from the time varying data. The events have five contours: peaks, up-ramp, down-ramp, rise time and fall time. 

### The RBA project has two phases. This repository is based on the firtst phase. 
### Phase 1: RBA developement in MATLAB environment
### Phase 2: RBA_theta developement in Python environment


## RBA_theta
### RBA_theta builds on top of the phase 1 developement of RBA. The improvements include addition of parameters for event classification. The list of parameters for one event are: peaks, threshold, up-ramp, down-ramp, persistence, frequency, angle, rainflow counting cycles.

### The developed RBA_theta model is applied for scenario generation of wind power events. 
### The novel mechanism to utilize the spatial markov-chain transition matrix to generate scenarios of events based on probability of occurances.
