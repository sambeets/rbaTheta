# <h1> rbaTheta: Ramping Behaviour Analysis

**Definition**: A sudden change in time-varying data is termed as an event. For example, a day (24 h) can be summed up with a few
events rather than 24 individual points. This algorithm identifies such events and classifies them into **stationary** or **significant** events.
An abrupt change is understood as a **significant** event, while a persistent flat interval is classified as **stationary**. The rest of the data carry little
importance in decision-making contexts.

### â–¶ How to Run

To run an experiment:

`python main.py`

It calls the enhanced model and helper functions from the core/ directory and executes them using multiprocessing.

For metric comparison of all methods after the simulation:

`python metric_comparison.py`

Upon completion, the console will display execution time and generate plots and comparison summaries.

### Environment Setup

Export cross-platform environment (from Windows):

```conda env export --no-builds | findstr -v "prefix" > rba_non-spatial_environment.yml```

Create a new conda environment:
```
conda env create --name m_rba -f rba_non-spatial_environment.yml
conda activate m_rba
```
