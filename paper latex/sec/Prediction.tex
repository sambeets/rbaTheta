Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) might be less potent than feed-forward networks but they are applicable in some cases which require communication between each neuron as it is in our task.


LSTM is a specified RNN architecture, and it is one of the most applicable networks for forecast time series. RNN is possibly the closest network that mimics the human brain. As it can be understood from the term “long-short”, the aim of this network is to model temporal sequences and their long-term dependencies. LSTM uses stochastic gradient descent as an optimization tool. The reason behind RNN outperforms than feed-forward networks is it contains cyclic connections. Thanks to these connections it is easier to model sequence data \cite{sak2014long}.
